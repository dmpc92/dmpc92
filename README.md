### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_Welcome to my profile!_

As a coding student with over 5 years of technical support experience, I am eager to transition to a Developer Trainee position to gain hands-on experience in software development. My technical support background has equipped me with strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for software development. Additionally, I acquired experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as MySQL through various coding exercises and projects completed during my coding education.

### **Skills:**
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
* Experience with programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript
* Familiarity with MySQL
* Ability to write technical documentation and user manuals
* Experience with version control systems such as Git


On my GitHub profile, you can find examples of my coding skills and exercises, which demonstrate my experience with programming languages and software development concepts. As a coding student, I have completed various exercises using Java, Python, JavaScript, and MySQL, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my coding knowledge and skills. I am also familiar with version control systems such as Git and actively participate in coding communities to learn and improve my coding abilities.
